Generative diffusion for regional surrogate modeling of sea-ice physics
======================================

This repository is the official implementation for the paper:
Finn et al. (2024), Generative diffusion for regional surrogate models from sea-ice simulations, submitted to the "Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES)"
and available as preprint soon.

The full repository including the dataset and neural network weights is available on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10949057).

The notebooks included in this repository are used to generate the data and Figures included in the paper.
The Weights & Biases projects needed to recreate the Figures will be made available as soon as possible.

--------

This repository is a project about generative diffusion for regional surrogate modeling from sea-ice simulation data, here neXtSIM.
To instantiate the diffusion models, the model makes extensive use of the accompanying repository https://github.com/cerea-daml/ddm-dynamical.

This readme will be further extended in the future, e.g., showing how the surrogate models can be used for forecasting.
